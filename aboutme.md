### Mission
The goal of this app is the following functional aspects:

- Help first time buyers and serve existing owners. "The Missing Operations Manual".
- "Level out" the learning curve for new buyers.
- Channel funding after operational costs to good causes, like the Humane Society.

Some technical aspects:

- Mobile-first - RV people have **wheels** on their houses for a reason!
- Offline-mode as a 1st class app function. You always have trees but not cell signal!

### Background
