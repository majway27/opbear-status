### Mission
- Our goal is to serve potential, new, and experienced RV/Trailer owners.  <span class="text-danger">"The Missing Operations Manual".</span>
- We are owners who love to camp and travel in our RV/Trailers.
- We intend to channel funding after operational costs to good causes, like the Humane Society.

### New and Potential Owners
- **"Level out"** the learning curve for new buyers.
- Save others from **learning the hard way** like we did.

### Experienced Owners
- Build and share digital **tools** we that we (site operators) find useful for our RVs.
- We hope our craftsmanship will speak for itself through positive reviews and referrals.

### Technical Blah-blah
- Mobile-first - RV people have **wheels** on their houses for a reason!
- Offline-mode as a 1st class app function. You always have wheels and trees, but not a cell signal!
