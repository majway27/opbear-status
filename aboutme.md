### Mission
- Our goal is to serve potential, new, and experienced RV/Trailer owners.  "The Missing Operations Manual".
- We are owners who love to camp and travel in our RV/Trailers.

### New and Potential Owners
- "Level out" the learning curve for new buyers.
- Save others from learning the hard way like we did.

### Experienced Owners
- Build and share digital tools we that we (site operators) find useful for our RVs.
- We hope our craftsmanship will speak for itself through positive reviews and referrals.

### Technical Blah-blah
- Mobile-first - RV people have **wheels** on their houses for a reason!
- Offline-mode as a 1st class app function. You always have wheels and trees, but not a cell signal!

### Background
